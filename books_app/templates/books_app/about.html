    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to eBooks, a simple and fast way to access a local collection of digital books. 
      This project is designed to make book sharing easy and efficient for our community.

    <p>
      Our goal is to provide a centralized catalog where users can browse available titles and request them directly. 
      The entire project is open source, and you can view the code, track progress, or contribute on our GitHub repository.
